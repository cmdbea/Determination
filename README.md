# Determination
Adds the Determination origin to the Origins mod.  

This adds a new Undertale inspired origin. It includes a couple of drawbacks and perks. If you want to contact me about the Origin  
with any recommendations then find me on the Official Origins Discord. I have my DM's open there for this specific reason.

**Determination Origin:**

*A pacifist at heart. You don't like hurting anyone, no matter what they did.*

:green_circle: **Pure Determination:** You start off with more hearts than usual, thanks to your determined self. (5+ Hearts)

:green_circle: **Training:** You've trained with Undyne and you're now faster than most. (0.15+ Speed)

:green_circle: **Last Stand:** Maybe with what little power you have... You can SAVE something else? (Regeneration 2 for 15 seconds every 2 Minutes and 30 Seconds.)

:yellow_circle: **Vegetarian:** You can no longer eat any type of meat.

:yellow_circle: **Pacifist:** You don't like killing, as so, you are really weak. (Weakness 1 PERMANENTLY.)

:red_circle: **Genocide Runs:** You can't go to sleep, If you do, you'll see all those times that your friends died, by **YOUR** hands. (Can't Sleep.)

:red_circle: **Hotland Sucked:** You dislike the warm, after being chased through Hotland. (25%+ More damage from fire.)
